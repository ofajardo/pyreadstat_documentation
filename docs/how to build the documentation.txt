It assumes you have compiled the cython extension in place
(python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace), so that sphinx will find it.

you need to have installed sphinx. You do if you are using anaconda.
You will also need numpydocs, you have if you have anaconda, otherwise install with pip.
In addition, install the readthedocs theme:

pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

Then, open a shell, navigate to this folder, and do: 

make html

The refreshed documentation will be in _build/html/index.html.

## how this was done

This is a good resource to learn how to use sphinx:
https://codeandchaos.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/sphinx-autodoc-tutorial-for-dummies/

There are however some differences with cython and not everything is explained well enough in the internet.
Here there is a resource on how to compile cython:
https://github.com/abingham/cython-sphinx-example

But it is very sensitive and unstable, there a are a few things to note:

IN summary:
1- Create a folder docs in your repository. It has to be called docs because that is what git likes.
2- in a shell, go there and do sphinx-quickstart. when asked about autodocs say yes. When asked about keeping separated source and build directories say no, 
this is very important, for some reason if it is separated it will not work for cython. Other options just the default. 
3- Open the file conf.py and:
   a) Look for the line where you are inserting into sys.path. Make sure you insert a path where you could import your module (.. because sources and build are not separated)
   b) In the list extensions, add 'sphinx.ext.napoleon'. 'numpydoc' gives errors (assuming your docstrigs are in numpy style). 
   c) In the line about html_theme, comment alabaster and insert: (previosly you need to install sphinx_rtd_theme via pip).
		import sphinx_rtd_theme
		html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
		html_theme_path = [sphinx_rtd_theme.get_html_theme_path()]
3.5 - In the file index.rst, it should look like this:
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

.. automodule:: pyreadstat.pyreadstat
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    
for some reason :undoc-members is absolutely necessary otherwise nothing is shown. pyreadstat.pyreadstat as well.

4- Just in the folders doc, create a file .nojekyll otherwise github pages will ignore all folders with
   underscores (sphinx loves them) and you page won't be rendered correctly.
   In addition create a file index.html and write on it:
   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./_build/html/index.html" />
   this will re-direct to the index.html created by sphinx. If it is produced somewhere else, adapt the path.
   Copy .nojekyll and add it to _build/html as well.
5- Now, in the shell run "make html". This should generate build/html/index.html check that it is good.
5.5- If you have built the docs on BEE, download it to windows if the git is on windows.
6- Commit your changes to the repo.
7- Go to your github repo, settings and enable githubpages from a docs folder. 
8- You should now be able to browse to your new github pages.
